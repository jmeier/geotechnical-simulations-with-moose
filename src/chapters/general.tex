In the [SolidMechanics] module and the [PorousFlow] module the sign convention
is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
      \item Positive strain is extensional, which (usually) results from a positive
            (tensile) stress.
      \item Negative strain is compressional, which (usually) results from a negative
            (compressive) stress.
      \item Compressive pore-pressures (e.g. below a free water table) have a positive
            sign.
      \item Suction is represented by pore-pressures having a negative sign.
\end{itemize}
