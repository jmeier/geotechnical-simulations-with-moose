The open-source, parallel finite element framework Moose
(\url{mooseframework.inl.gov}) can also be used to perform simulations that are
used in the geotechnical design practice. This document aims to collect options
and techniques that are suitable for creating such geotechnical simulations
with Moose.

In the geotechnical planning practice, finite element models are often used for
deformation prognosis. Furthermore, such FE models can help to identify complex
failure mechanisms. The requirements for these models are accordingly a
sufficiently good representation of the geotechnical structure including the
subsoil, the groundwater conditions, pre-existing structures and similar. These
FE models simulate the construction process over time. As this design process
is generally intended to take place in a controlled and quasi-static form, the
associated simulations are usually also transient and quasi-static. Therefore,
scope and main focus of this document are transient quasi-static simulations.
