The open-source, parallel finite element framework Moose (\url{mooseframework.inl.gov})
can also be used to perform geotechnical simulations. This document aims to collect
options and techniques that are suitable for creating such geotechnical simulations
with mosses. Main focus are quasi-static simulations.

This document is primarily intended as a collection of information rather than a
textbook or step-by-step guide.
