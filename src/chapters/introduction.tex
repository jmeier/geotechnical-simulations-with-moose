The open-source, parallel finite element framework Moose
(\url{mooseframework.inl.gov}) can also be used to perform geotechnical
simulations. This document aims to collect options and techniques that are
suitable for creating such geotechnical simulations with Moose. Main focus are
quasi-static simulations.

This document is primarily intended as a collection of information rather than
a textbook or step-by-step guide. As such, it is intended to be a 'living'
document that will be continually edited and updated.
