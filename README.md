By enabling massively parallel multiphysics simulation the 
open-source, finite element framework Moose
([mooseframework.inl.gov](https://mooseframework.inl.gov)) 
can also be used for geotechnical design practice. This 
document aims to collect information and techniques that 
are suitable for creating such geotechnical simulations 
with Moose. Main focus are quasi-static simulations.

This whitepaper ([PDF](geotechnical-simulations-with-moose.pdf)) 
collects information and code for geotechnical simulations with 
the software Moose. This document is primarily intended as a 
collection of information and examples rather than a textbook or 
step-by-step guide. As such, it is intended to be a ’living’ 
document that will be continually edited and updated.
